## Goal
> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.

The goal is to predict the probability that a patient has heart disease for better prevention.

### Dataset :

**Missing values** : No.

**Attributes** : 13

1- *slope_of_peak_exercise_st_segment* (type: int): the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, an electrocardiography read out indicating quality of blood flow to the heart

2- *thal* (type: categorical): results of thallium stress test measuring blood flow to the heart, with possible values normal, fixed_defect, reversible_defect

3- *resting_blood_pressure* (type: int): resting blood pressure

4- *chest_pain_type* (type: int): chest pain type (4 values)

5- *num_major_vessels* (type: int): number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

7- *resting_ekg_results* (type: int): resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8- *serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl* (type: int): serum cholestoral in mg/dl

9- *oldpeak_eq_st_depression* (type: float): oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, a measure of abnormality in electrocardiograms

10- *sex* (type: binary): 0: female, 1: male

11- *age* (type: int): age in years

12- *max_heart_rate_achieved* (type: int): maximum heart rate achieved (beats per minute)
